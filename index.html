In comparison to traditional financial assets, renewables like solar and wind are a fascinating topic as their producing capacity is bound to intangible natural resources with
ever repeating periodic cycles. Due to continuous deregulation of this sector, the sales process gains more and more exposure to the power market, which itself is quite a challenging
and interesting asset. Apart from renewables being quite a hot topic, I have decided to start this blog with two goals. Firstly generating an idea pool for mathematical models, which
have been elevating due to mentioned regulatory changes. Secondly discuss and illustrate "models that work at work" for risk management and sales optimisation purposes.
