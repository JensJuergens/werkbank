In comparison to traditional financial assets, renewables like solar and wind are a fascinating topic as their producing capacity is bound to intangible natural resources with
ever repeating periodic cycles. Due to continuous deregulation of this sector, the sales process gains more and more exposure to the power market, which itself is quite a challenging
and interesting asset. My posts are concerned about mathematical models behind described renewables mechanisms and should illustrate "models that work at work" for risk management and sales
optimisation purposes.
