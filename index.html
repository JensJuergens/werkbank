In comparison to traditional financial assets, renewables like solar and wind are a fascinating topic as their producing capacity is bound to intangible natural ressources with
ever repeating periodic cycles. With continuous deregulation of this sector, the sales process gains more and more exposure to the power market, which itself is quite an challenging
and interesting asset. This page is concerned about mathematical models behind renewables mechanisms and points at the illustration of "models that work at work" for risk management and sales
optimisation purposes.
