In March more than 35% of Germany's [power production](https://w3.windmesse.de/windenergie/news/31115-rekord-monat-erneuerbare-energie-strommix-deutschland-anteil-windenergie) was produced by renewable energy. But have you ever wondered, if this record number is going to continue through the coming months? This question can neither be easily answered, nor are we able to make a crystal ball. But we can try to sketch the future with statistical means, hence my first post is about the setup of a nice, small model, which is capable of forecasting daily production volumes of renewable power plants while being analytically tractable. We will enhance and modify the model in the upcoming posts, so it will be "our model" for answering all questions about energy production. All calculations are done with R and are implementations of methods carried out in the cited academic papers.
## Data Description
What we see in the plot below are the daily production profiles of a German wind farm (turquoise) and a Romanian solar park (golden).

After having a first look at the chart, we observe a clear yearly, seasonal pattern which results from the availability of the natural resources wind and sun. In other words, there is a lot more wind in the winter season as in summertime. Consequently, the wind production volume rises with the beginning of the winter season. Looking at the solar production profile, we observe quite the opposite behaviour, as sun intensity is more prominent in summertime. Of course, this results in rising solar production in respective season. This pattern can further be drilled down to monthly as well as weekly seasonality forces the observed production profiles to behave as curvy as they do.

What both charts have in common is a production behaviour, which quickly returns to its seasonal mean after rapidly surging with a spike. Evidently these spikes appear far more often and are thus more prevalent in wind production than in regards to a solar power plant. This is also due to the fact, that we generally experience wind more unstable than cozy sun intensity. Consequently, the renewable asset class wind should be far more volatile than the Romanian photovoltaic power plant. But let us see, what the numbers say in the end.
## The model
In terms of model formulation we stick to the model of [Lucia&Schwartz](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013846631785) or [Kluge](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266336023_Pricing_Swing_Options_and_Other_Electricity_Derivatives) and adapt it to the power production case. We are going to evaluate the forecasting performance of this model at the end of this post. These kind of models are attractive, because they are tractable and parameters are relatively easy to calculate. Besides, using this formulation for production simulation purposes is not as unusual as it might seem at first sight (cf. [Benth](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2979341))

$$
\begin{matrix}
S(t) =  exp(f(t)+X(t)) \\
dX(t) = -\alpha X(t)dt+\sigma dW(t) \\
f(t)  =  a_0+\sum_{i=1}^6[a_i cos(2\pi\gamma_it)+b_i sin(2\pi\gamma_i t)] \\
\end{matrix}
$$

The truncated fourier series $f(t)$ is used to describe seasonality seen in the data above. A lot of different ways to capture seasonality have been tried out and we will stick to the following seasonality approach as it captures yearly, monthly as well as weekly seasonality. We set the parameters $$ \gamma_1 = 1, \gamma_2 = 2 ,\gamma_3 = 4, \gamma_4 = \frac{365}{7}, \gamma_5 = 2*\frac{365}{7}, \gamma_6 = 4*\frac{365}{7} $$, which corresponds to annually, semi-annually, quarterly, weekly, semi-weekly and quarter-weekly seasonality factors.

We use a logarithmic model, where the dynamic is driven by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Parameter $\alpha$ describes the mean reversion speed or in other words how fast the production returns to its seasonal mean after experiencing a spike. As usual $\sigma$ represents the volatility of the underlying.
## Calibration
As pointed out above, seasonality seems to play a major role in our time series. Hence we will firstly estimate the seasonality with a simple linear regression of trigonometric basis functions against the logarithm of observed daily production volumes. To uncover yearly seasonality we will use three years of historical daily production volumes. Results of the linear model are as follows:

    <figcaption> Seasonality per asset estimated by truncated fourier series </figcaption>
</figure>
To carry out a sensible calibration of the model parameters \alpha$ and $\sigma$, we have to remove disturbing patterns in the time series in order to arrive at the pure stochastic part. After determining the seasonality, we deseasonalize our log-Spot data by subtracting the seasonality function from the data.

    <figcaption> Deseasonalised observed production volume </figcaption>
</figure>
Now we are half-way done in extracting the pure stochastic part in our data. Given a wind farm there are a lot of artifacts, which result e.g. from O&M measure at the park. We will winsorize them out,so that these artifacts will not disturb our parameter estimation of $$ {\alpha, \sigma}  $$. After doing so, we arrive at the following stage:
<figure class="half">

    <figcaption> Deseasonalised and winsoried observed production volumes  </figcaption>
</figure>
Further calibration will be carried out by the means of a maximum likelihood estimation. We use the fact that transitional densities for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process are given, which helps us to boil the calibration down to numerical estimate $$ \alpha $$. The maximum likelihood method is carried out with a Brent Solver, all other parameters are then explicitly calculated through the estimated $$ \alpha $$.
## Backtesting of calibration results
 Disjunct quarterly, semi-annual as well as annual estimation horizons were tested and I recommend to use at least semi-annual daily observations in order to arrive at sensible estimation results. For the sake of fun I tried quarterly observation horizons out, but it seemed more than roulette to arrive at a density plot which has something to with actual power production profile. To use quarterly observation horizon, one must include hourly production to guarantee enough data points.

Let us have a look at the Romanian solar park:

Quite visually we see a reasonable fit between the real data and the artificial density function with our estimated parameters. Nevertheless, because the normal distribution is not capable of capturing the tails in the empirical distribution, precisely when we see the wind production.

What should we do now? For example we could start with normal mixture models and try to fit the tails of the observed distributions. Honestly I am not the biggest fan of normal mixture distribution as they are quite cumbersome in fitting. So I propose a family of distributions and we will use the Akaike Information Criterion to show the goodness of fit tests.
