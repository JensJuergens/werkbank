This short post is about the setup of a nice, small model, which is capable of forecasting daily production of renewable power plants while being analytically tractable. All calculations are done with R and are implementations of methods carried out in the mentioned academic papers.
## Data Description
What you see in the plot below are the daily production profiles of a German wind farm (turquoise) and a Romanian solar park (golden).

After having a first look at the chart, one observes a clear yearly, seasonal pattern which results from the availability of the natural resources wind and sun. In other words, there is a lot more wind in the winter season as in summertime. Consequently, the wind production volume rises with the beginning of the winter season. Looking at the solar production profile, we observe quite the opposite behaviour, as sun intensity is more prominent in summertime. Of course, this results in rising solar production in respective season. This pattern can further be drilled down to monthly as well as weekly seasonality forces the observed production profiles to behave as curvy as they do.

What both charts have in common is a production behaviour, which quickly returns to its seasonal mean after rapidly surging with a spike. Evidently these spikes appear far more often and are thus more prevalent in wind production than in regards to a solar power plant. This is also due to the fact, that we generally experience wind more unstable than cozy sun intensity. Consequently, the renewable asset class wind should be far more volatile than the Romanian photovoltaic power plant. But let us see, what the numbers say in the end.
## The model
In terms of model formulation we stick to the model of Lucia&Schwartz (cf. [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013846631785)) or Kluge (cf. [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266336023_Pricing_Swing_Options_and_Other_Electricity_Derivatives)) and adapt it to the power production case. We are going to evaluate the forecasting performance of this model at the end of this post. These kind of models are attractive, because they are tractable and parameters are relatively easy to calculate. Besides, using this formulation for production simulation purposes is not as unusual as it might seem at first sight (cf. Benth [link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2979341))

$$
\begin{matrix}
S(t) =  exp(f(t)+X(t)) \\
dX(t) = -\alpha X(t)dt+\sigma dW(t) \\
f(t)  =  a_0+\sum_{i=1}^6[a_i cos(2\pi\gamma_it)+b_i sin(2\pi\gamma_i t)] \\
\end{matrix}
$$

The truncated fourier series $f(t)$ is used to describe seasonality seen in the data above. A lot of different ways to capture seasonality have been tried out and we will stick to the following seasonality approach as it captures yearly, monthly as well as weekly seasonalities. We set the parameters $$ \gamma_1 = 1, \gamma_2 = 2 ,\gamma_3 = 4, \gamma_4 = \frac{365}{7}, \gamma_5 = 2*\frac{365}{7}, \gamma_6 = 4*\frac{365}{7} $$, which corresponds to annually, semi-annually, quarterly, weekly, semi-weekly and quarter-weekly seasonality factors.

We use a logarithmic model, where the dynamic is driven by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Parameter $\alpha$ describes the mean reversion speed or in other words how fast the production returns to its seasonal mean after experiencing a spike. As usual $\sigma$ represents the volatility of the underlying.
## Calibration
As pointed out above, seasonality seems to play a major role in our time series. Hence we will firstly estimate the seasonality with a simple linear regression of trigonometric basis functions against the logarithm of observed daily production volumes. To uncover yearly seasonalities we will use a 3 years of historical volumes. Results of the linear model are as follows:

</figure>
To carry out a sensible calibration of the model parameters \alpha$ and $\sigma$, one has to remove disturbing patterns in the time series in order to arrive at the pure stochastic part. After determining the seasonality, we deseasonalize our log-Spot data by subtracting the seasonality function from the data.

</figure>
Now we are half-way done in extracting the pure stochastic part in our data. Given a wind farm there are a lot of artifacts, which result e.g. from O&M measure at the park. We will winsorize them out, so that these artifacts will not disturb our parameter estimation of $$ {\alpha, \sigma}  $$. We arrive at the following stage:
<figure class="half">

    <figcaption> Deseasonalised and winsoried observed production volumes  </figcaption>
</figure>
Further calibration will be carried out by the means of a maximum likelihood estimation. We use the fact that transitional densities for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process are given, which helps us to boil the calibration down to numerical estimate $$ \alpha $$. The maximum likelihood method is carried out with a Brent Solver, all other parameters are then explicitly calculated through the given $$ \alpha $$.
## Backtesting of calibration results
 Disjunct quarterly, semi-annual as well as annual estimation horizons were tested and I recommend to use at least semi-annual daily observations in order to arrive at sensible estimation results. For the sake of fun I tried quarterly observation horizons out, but it seemed more than roulette to arrive at a density plot which has something to with actual power production profile. To use quarterly observation horizon, one must include hourly production to guarantee enough data points.
