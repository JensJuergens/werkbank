## Model Description
In terms of model formulation we stick to the model of Lucia&Schwartz [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013846631785) and adapt it to the power production case. We are going to evaluate the forecasting performance of this model at the end of this post. The model is attractive as it is tractable and relatively easy to calculate. Using this kind of model for production simulation purposes is not as unusual as it might seem at first sight (cf. Benth [link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2979341))

$$ S(t) =  exp(f(t)+X(t)) $$
$$ dX(t) = -\alpha X(t)dt+\sigma dW(t) $$
$$ f(t)  =  a_0+\sum_{i=1}^6[a_i cos(2\pi\gamma_it)+b_i sin(2\pi\gamma_i t)] $$

Here is some math:

\[p(\theta) = \mathbf{\prod}_{i,c}p(\mathbf{\theta}^i(c))\]

\begin{eqnarray*}
S(t)& = & exp(f(t)+X(t))
\\dX(t)& = &-\alpha X(t)dt+\sigma dW(t)
\\f(t) & = & a_0+\sum_{i=1}^6[a_i cos(2\pi\gamma_it)+b_i sin(2\pi\gamma_i t)]
\\f(t)& \sim & ln(S(t))
\\d[ln(S(t))]& = &\alpha*[b(t)-ln[S(t)]]dt+\sigma dW(t)
\\b(t)& = &f(t)+\frac{1}{\alpha}(\frac{df}{dt}+\sigma^2/2)
\end{eqnarray*}

$$ E = mc^2 $$

$$  p(\theta) = \mathbf{\prod}_{i,c}p(\mathbf{\theta}^i(c)) $$
