Showing first results of this post to a co-worker of mine, he said: "You did a great job turning Australia into a pink porcupine".

Why do I come along with Australia now? In my opinion, Australia is quite an interesting country, when it comes to renewables. Obviously from one's gut feeling it is an appropriate location for installing a lot of PV farms. But of course due to the huge coastline there should be also great wind spots as well. Thinking about my [first post](https://jensjuergens.github.io/werkbank/initial/) Australia could be a perfect playground for combining wind an PV. Last, but not least, I would like to mention that the biggest [Power to Gas](https://arena.gov.au/projects/jemena-power-to-gas-demonstration/) plant will be built in Australia. Remembering my [second post](https://jensjuergens.github.io/werkbank/second/), lack of feed-in tariffs could make this country a suitable precedent for a combined renewables super power plant with full merchant risk.

From a nerd perspective - similar to Scandinavia - Australia is attractive as there is a lot of free meteorological data. Futhermore, you can add all kinds of meteorological data from [NASA](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) and [GSOD](https://ropensci.github.io/GSODR/index.html). Hence, we have a giant database of all kinds of weather data at hand, which we can use. And this is really a good opportunity to say thanks to [Adam Sparks](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bomrang/index.html) for giving me the hint to this wonderful and free data sources.

## Analysis approach
Having acquired wind speed data from different sources, there is the simple [Betz's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law), which allows us to transform the wind data into potential production volume of a windmill. Again we will use the model from our last post, namely the Gamma distribution to deduce statistical results from the given wind speed data, remembering that this distribution is a good choice in regards to tail behaviour. In order to measure the goodness of potential locations we adapt the [Sharpe Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) to our wind production setting. Let us define:

$$
\begin{align*}
S_a &:=  \frac{E[X]}{\sigma_X}
\end{align*}
$$

where $$E[X]$$ is the expected wind production and $$\sigma_X$$ represents the square-root of its variance. Latter is derived from the estimated Gamma distribution parameters, expected production is set as the mode of the gamma distribution. General setup of the algorithm is quite straight-forward. On potential location given by its longitude and latitude, we will fit the gamma distribution on a de-asonalised, winsorized logarithm of the three year's daily power production history estimated by Betz's law calibrated with moment's matching method. Again for each grid point we will calculate the above defined sharpe ratio. The higher this ratio is, the better is the wind location as it means, that there should be high production volume with low variability in production returns.

We split Australia into a find longitude and latitude grid. For each grid point we carry out the analysis above. In order to present results in a flashy way, I used [mapdeck](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck). Interpretation is quite straight-forward. Spots, where columns are brightly shining, high and dense represent good wind farm locations.

## Journey through data
![NASA data analysis](https://github.com/JensJuergens/werkbank/blob/master/images/NASA_cellsize6000_elevscale250_short.gif)

We now clearly discover a disadvantage of the small sized NASA grid. We definitely discover certain areas, which are attractive wind locations. Obviously we see huge regions, where one has stable blowing wind off-shore. When it comes to on-shore locations the situation gets more and more tricky. Obviously Tasmania seems to be a place to build, but more on that later.

To put more detail in this analysis and in order to concentrate on specific spots, we further investigate wind farm locations with GSOD data set. This data is provided by weather stations on Australian soil. There you are certainly limited by spots, where the weather station stands. We will carry out the same analysis as with the NASA data on the weather stations. Combining both should give us not only an areal impression, but also spot related impression, where we should build the wind farms.

But of what use is a good wind farm location on Coconut Island? Evidently we need some more infrastructure in order to get the produced power to the customer. Hence, we grab the freely available grid data from the Australian government and put it as another layer onto the map. Combination of all three layers should tell us at least to a certain amount spots, where it could be promising to build a plant.


## Summary
Obviously New South Wales and Tasmania look like promising regions. Unfortunately New South Wales has already seen quite a development, when it comes to wind sites. On the opposite Queensland would be more interesting, as there aren't so many wind farms built yet. Looking at our sharpe ratio map, we would perceive the area around Muttaburra as a promising region. Unfortunately, as a frustrated developer in a recent newspaper harshly said, [Queensland is dead to us](https://reneweconomy.com.au/how-serious-is-queensland-about-its-50-per-cent-renewable-energy-target-94652/). The sunshine state could surely install a lot of solar plants. Accompanying these plants with wind would generate good [balancing effects](https://jensjuergens.github.io/werkbank/initial/), which would certainly outperform any gray energy. However relatively new coal power plants were built recently, so seemingly there is an opposition against the competing renewable energy.

Again looking at the map also Tasmania seems to be a promising region. Short research shows, that only 2 operational wind farms exist in [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolnorth_Wind_Farm). Most of energy here is delivered by hydro power plants. There exists an undersea grid line to the mainland.

Backtesting of results should be done with [windpower](https://www.thewindpower.net/windfarm_map_en_10457_waterloo-wind-farm.php).

## Sources
Data is obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center POWER Project funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate Applied Science Program. It goes without saying, that with the help of NASA we could carry out lots of analysis on wind, solar and hydro in every country we wish. For this post we will focus on Australia and will try to mine potential wind farm locations, which promise us high potential production with low variability in returns.
